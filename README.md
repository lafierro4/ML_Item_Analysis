# League of Legends Item Analyzer

Since its launch in 2009, League of Legends has undergone constant development, with its item system having a significant impact on player tactics and overall game balance. Character abilities may be improved and the meta of the game can be changed by in-game items that can be purchased by players using gold they earn during matches. Our project's goal was to build machine learning models that, given these items' information, can forecast their gold efficiency and cost. Precisely anticipating these factors can help creators establish a balance between the power and cost of items, offer insights into the dynamics of the game, and enhance the overall experience for players.
